# Deep Dive: Flutter's (Stateful) Widget Lifecycle
Every Flutter Widget has a built-in lifecycle: A collection of methods that are automatically executed by Flutter (at certain points of time).

There are three extremely important (stateful) widget lifecycle methods you should be aware of:

- initState(): Executed by Flutter when the StatefulWidget's State object is initialized

- build(): Executed by Flutter when the Widget is built for the first time AND after setState() was called

- dispose(): Executed by Flutter right before the Widget will be deleted (e.g., because it was displayed conditionally)

You will encounter them all multiple times throughout the course - therefore you don't have to memorize them now and you will see them in action. It's still worth learning about them right now already.
